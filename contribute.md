This application software is made up in AHK Language. AutoHotkey is a free, open-source custom scripting language for Microsoft Windows, initially aimed at providing easy 
keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys, fast macro-creation and software automation that allows users of most levels of computer skill to automate repetitive tasks in any Windows 
application.

AutoHotkey scripts can be used to launch programs, open documents, emulate keystrokes, Unicode characters, and mouse clicks and movements. AutoHotkey scripts can also assign,
retrieve, and manipulate variables, run loops and manipulate windows, files, and folders. These commands can be triggered by a hotkey, such as a script that would open an internet
browser whenever the user presses Ctrl+Alt+I on the keyboard. Keyboard keys can also be remapped or disabled, such that pressing Ctrl+N, for example, might result in the active 
window receiving an en dash (–), or nothing at all. AutoHotkey also allows for 'hotstrings' that will automatically replace certain text as it is typed; the most typical use for 
hotstrings is expanding abbreviations, such as assigning the string "btw" to produce the text "by the way" when typed, or the text "%o" to produce "percentage of. Further, some
scripts can be initiated automatically at computer startup and need not interact with the keyboard at all, perhaps performing file manipulation at a set interval.

More complex tasks can be achieved with custom data entry forms (GUI windows), working with the system registry, or using the Windows API by calling functions from DLLs. 
The scripts can be compiled into an executable file that can be run on other computers that do not have AutoHotkey installed. The source code is in C++ and can be compiled with
Visual Studio Express.

Memory access through pointers is allowed just as in C.

Some uses for AutoHotkey:

Remapping the keyboard, such as from QWERTY to Dvorak or other alternative keyboard layouts.
Using shortcuts to fill in frequently-used file names or other phrases.
Typing punctuation not provided on the keyboard, such as curved quotes (“…”).
Controlling the mouse cursor with a keyboard or joystick.
Opening programs, documents, and websites with simple keystrokes.
Adding a signature to e-mail, message boards, etc.
Monitoring a system and automatically closing unwanted programs.
Scheduling an automatic reminder, system scan, or backup.
Automating repetitive tasks.
Filling out contest and freebie forms automatically (i.e., it can type in your name, address, etc. automatically).
Prototyping before implementing in another, more time-consuming, programming language.
